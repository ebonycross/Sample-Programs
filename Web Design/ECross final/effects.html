		The establishment and advancement of European settlements has been both positive
		 and negative. Many adverse effects have results not only for non-European settlers 
		 but also for the environment. The needs of European settlers has been great and 
		 requiring much the environment’s natural resources.  However, these requirements 
		 has left he environment adversely molded. </br></br>
		 
		Once such noted effect is the disappearance of the North American Passenger pigeon.  
		In North American, Passenger pigeons used to be the most abundant bird.  However, the
		species was over hunted as a food source and their habitats were destroyed.  This led
		to a sharp decline in the population of Passenger pigeons and ultimately their
		extinction.  By 1900, scientist had deemed the population as nearly extinct.  
		The Passenger pigeon known as “Martha”, was the last known living Passenger pigeon. 
		On September 1, 1914, the Passenger pigeon known as Martha, died.  With the death 
		of this bird, the specie known as the Passenger Pigeon would officially be considered extinct.
