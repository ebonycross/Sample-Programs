 In the Northern states, the Industrial 
Revolution began the transition for manufacturing merely by hand to implementation of machines.
 Railroads, textile mills, steamboats and other various manufacturing productions were being
 manufactured in the Northeast. Textile mills were a dominate source of income for the economy 
 for which a new sources of profit in the Northern states were created. The newly invented 
 industry opened up for economy investments both domestically and internationally. However,
  the industrialization of the economy resulted in extreme variances in standard living
   conditions between lucrative investors in the industrial industry and the social economically
    low workers.  The populations in the peripheral living areas of industrial factories were
     extremely dense and disease stricken.  In these urban areas, there was a particularly
      high rate of death among young children, due to extreme unsanitary conditions within
       confined dwellings.</br></br>


Meanwhile, in the Southern states, the crop industry flourished. In the southern states, 
crops such as cotton continued as a rich source of profit for the 
American economy.   The industries were fast growing and required large amounts of laborers.
  Southern states utilized slaves to resolve the growing issue of labor through the use of African 
  slave trade.  Furthermore, the internal slave trade also became a very lucrative source of profit 
  for the Southern economy.  </br> </br>
  
 The issue of slavery as well as several other 
 conflicts led to the succession of the southern states from the northern states.  
 Eventually this issue led to the American Civil War.  The war officially lasted four 
 long years in which the industrial Northern states (also known as the Union) battled and 
 fought against the agricultural southern states (also known as the Confederates).  The war
  had a gruesome death rate of nearly eight percent of all Caucasian males between the ages
   of 13 to 43. However, ultimate the Union army won the war and slavery was abolished and 
   the junction of the United States was restored.
