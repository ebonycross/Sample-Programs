	<h2>17th Century: The Settlement of the Pilgrims </h2>
	
	<div class="contentAlt">

		<p>
		During the 1600s, a religious group of Puritan Separatists known as the Pilgrims, 
wanted to disconnect themselves from the Church of England.  Pilgrims believed they had
divine destinies in humanity to save souls and bring people to God for redemption. John 
Calvin was the leader of the Pilgrims.  As the leader of the separatist group, Calvin taught
the Pilgrims purity must be obtained through isolation from society, which was believed to
be populated with sinners.  In order to remove interaction and cohabitation with 
non-Puritans, Pilgrims set sail for North America.</br></br> 
 
 
After a turbulent voyage, stricken with death and famine, the early Pilgrims (also known as Pilgrim Fathers) set root in present-day Plymouth,
Massachusetts.  Fortunately, the group was successful in establishing the new colony. In fact, in 1620, the 
Settlements in Plymouth lead as the second most successful European colonization in North America, right behind Jamestown, Virginia. 
In 1621, the Pilgrims had the infamous feast that bought into union the Pilgrim settlers and Native Americans of that region.  
This feast would become known as the beginning of the infamous holiday called Thanksgiving.
