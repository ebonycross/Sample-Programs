During the time of early European settlements in North America, the British Empire held great reign and power 
not only in the North America but as well as Europe.  Between the time periods of 
1607 and 1733, Great Britain established thirteen colonies on the Atlantic Coast.  The 
thirteen colonies that were established were in fact, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
 Georgia, Massachusetts Bay, Maryland, Connecticut, South Carolina, New Hampshire, 
 Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island.  With Great Britain in control 
 of the main European colonized settlement, government and rule came directly 
 from the British Empire.</br></br>  

Britain rule over The Thirteen Colonies was very strict.  The empire enforced mercantile 
economy which foundation was to maintain domination on rival political and national powers. 
As a result, Britain banned colonies from trading with other nations which further allowed the empire to maintain a strong grip on their reign while monopolizing all economic markets. The British government had raised
taxes to an outrageously high rate for the thirteen American colonies.  This imposition
 upset the American colonies that felt over ruled by England’s government.</br></br> 

In 1775, the American Revolutionary war began.  The revolt against Britain’s control 
of the thirteen American colonies lasted for eight years.  Fortunately, the American 
colonies were able to defeat Great Britain, which ultimately solidified their 
independence from England.  In July 1776, American colony officials declared their independence
and Congress gave breath to the creation of the Continental Army with leadership 
by General George Washington. Following the American Revolutionary War,  authorities that had allegiance with 
Britain were forced to evacuated the settlements he previously occupied in the United States.  The event was known as Evacuation Day.
