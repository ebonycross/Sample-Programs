For thousands of years people have lived in community settlements. 
Settlements vary in size, function and cultural history.
Most settlements have common patterns of habitation. 
By definition of the National Geographic, a human settlement is a geological 
designation of a group of individuals in which there is shared habitation. 
These shared human settlements are defined in terms of size, location, organization, 
relational history, common purpose and interests. </br></br> 

The history of North American human settlements is one of diverse background, motives, 
purpose, and outcome.  The history of European settlements in North America is a 
historical tale that has been both pivotal and ultimately defining to present day society in North America.  
Nevertheless, European settlements in North America has not always been seen as beneficial to all co-habitators. 
Adverse effects have occurred in 
nature that have permanently shifted the balance of the surrounding environment.  
Case in point, due to human habitation certain populations of species became 
endangered or some even extinct.  One such case occurred to a group of birds in 
North America called the North American Passenger Pigeon.  Fortunately, with 
modern technology, we are improving the effects of human habitation and in some 
cases  reversing  some of the negative side effects of human settlement. These 
advancements in modern technology have given hope to the restoration of some of the 
balance in environment that was lost on the behalf of human progression in North 
America.  However, for now, only time will tell.
