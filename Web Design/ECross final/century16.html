		By the start of the 1500s, Christopher Columbus had already arrived at the North American continent. 
At the time, the population of European settlers was very small in comparison to later years. 
 Spanish voyagers dominated exploration of North America.  The Spaniards economically invested in the 
 trade and extraction of gold and spices in the East.  However, competition arose amongst European 
 Kingdoms to find new and efficient methods of bringing the extracted goods back to Europe. 
  Ultimately, the Kingdom of France was the first to seek a western route of travel for trade. </br></br>
  
In 1534, by the request of King Francis this first, Jacques Cartier sailed the Pacific Ocean in hopes 
of discovering a northwestern route.  Upon discovering land on the North American continent,
     Cartier immediately claimed the territory for rule under the French Kingdom.  As a result, the
 French set up lucrative fur trading posts in North America that would send the luxury furs items back to Europe to be sold. 
 Thus, the French empire began to rise in North America. </br></br>
 
Trading from North America became a staple of European economy. Small European settlements began to a 
rise in areas where trading was being conducted.  European settlers also extracted natural resources for 
trade such as iron, fish, coral, leather and even sea salt.  All goods that were extracted were sent back to Europe for sell.  However, the European travelers initially needed assistance in the extraction of natural resources.  In order to begin the extraction, European voyageurs sought out Native Americans in the assistance of exploration and utilization of the North American lands.  Native Americans, however, were reluctant to help the foreign European settlers and so conflict over the land territory began.  Tension boiled over and violent clashes between groups aroused. 
While European settlements continued to expand, the Native American settlements suffered and have adverse outcomes.  Europeans brought
 diseases to the lands upon their settlement for which Natives had no biological defense.  As a result of 
 the violent conflict and biological illness from the European settlers, the populations of Native American 
 settlements were devastated and drastically declined.  The control of territory was a conflict that the Native Americans ultimately lost against the European settlers.
