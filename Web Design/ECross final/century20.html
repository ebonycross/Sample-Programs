	<h2>The 20th Century: The Progressive Era </h2>
	
	<div class="contentAlt">

The 1900s were known as The Progressive Era.  Cities offer many jobs in factories and 
		administrative departments. The manufacturing business created a new staple of the
		American economy. The rapidly growing and expanding industrial labor market lured
		immigrants from other countries as well as others looking for work. As industrialization continued to
		grow and advance, so did the development of urban settlements in the cities. 
		A large surge of American citizens and immigrants alike relocated from rural farm 
		areas closer to the cities. While many people who took residence in the city stayed 
		in deplorable and over-populated living conditions, the era was still considered an 
		“Age of Great Prosperity”. </br></br> 

 		Unfortunately, wall street crashed in October 1929 and so began the collapse the 
 		foundation of the economy. One result was a sharp halt on industrial manufacturing, 
 		 had been a dominating sector in the American economy.  As production steeply 
 		declined, the unemployment levels dramatically rose. People no longer had a means 
 		to financially maintain their homes and so there was an onset of national epidemic 
 		of homelessness. A new form of human settlements called Hooverville began to appear 
 		frequently across the nation.  According the PBS documentary, "America 1900", the 
 		term Hooverville was popularized after the U.S. President, Herbert Hoover, who was 
 		greatly blamed for the cause of The Great Depression. The term was used to describe 
 		squatter or informal living areas. Hundreds of "Hoovervilles" were created across the 
 		nation during the 1930s where thousands of people occupied these shanty areas.</br></br> 

		The economy eventually recovered, however, The Great Depression officially lasted for ten devastating years.  
		The Great Depression era remains known as the most devastating and longest-lasting economic plummet in the 
		history of the United States.
